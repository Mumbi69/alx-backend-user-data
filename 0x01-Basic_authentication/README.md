# Basic authentication
* Authentication:
> * Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system.
> * It ensures that the person or system trying to access a resource is actually who or what it claims to be.
> * Authentication can be done using various methods, such as passwords, biometric data (fingerprint, face recognition), tokens, etc.
* Base64:
> * Base64 is a method for encoding binary data, such as images or files, into a ASCII string format.
> * It uses a set of 64 different ASCII characters to represent the binary data, hence the name Base64.
> * The encoded string is longer than the original binary data, but it can be safely transmitted as text, for example in email or JSON.
* Encoding a string in Base64:
> * To encode a string in Base64, you can use a programming language's built-in functions or libraries.
* Basic Authentication:
> * Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol.
> * It involves sending a username and password in the HTTP headers of a request.
> * The credentials are base64 encoded before being sent, which means they are not secure unless used over HTTPS.
* Sending the Authorization header:
> * To send the Authorization header with basic authentication, you need to include it in the HTTP headers of your request.
> * The header value should be "Basic " followed by the base64 encoded string of "username:password".
